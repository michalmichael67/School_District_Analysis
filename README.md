# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis

In this project, the goal was to analyze the data from one school district in order to create a more tranparent view on what could cause differences in the performance of each school. As part of this, we looked into math and reading scores by grade, how fnding affects math and reading scores, how school size affects math and reading scores, and how school type affects math and reading scores. Additionally, in order to uphold academic honesty standards, this analysis was conducted twice to account for academic dishonesty within the 9th grade of Thomas High school.  

## Results
